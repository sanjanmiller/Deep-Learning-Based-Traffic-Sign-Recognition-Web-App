# 🚦 Deep Learning-Based Traffic Sign Recognition Web App  

This project is a **Deep Learning-based Traffic Sign Classifier** built with **TensorFlow/Keras** and deployed as a **Streamlit web app**. Users can upload an image of a traffic sign, and the model will predict its category.  

## 📌 Features  
✔️ **Trained CNN model** for accurate traffic sign classification.  
✔️ **Streamlit-based web interface** for easy image upload and prediction.  
✔️ **Supports 43 traffic sign classes** from the German Traffic Sign Dataset.  
✔️ **Pre-trained model (traffic_sign.h5)** included for instant predictions.
